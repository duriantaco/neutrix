# Spyn

Spyn is an easy to use (hopefully) state management library for React applications. It is a state management library for React that simplifies complex state updates and computations. It provides a centralized store with computed values that automatically track dependencies, making it easier to maintain consistent application state.

## Why use Spyn?

* Computed values that track their own dependencies and update automatically
* LRU caching to optimize performance
* Clean handling of async state updates
* Built-in tools for connecting multiple stores
